## About The Project

WhatsApp Business Cloud API Integration is a powerful and robust tool that empowers businesses to automate sending and receiving of WhatsApp messages directly from their Empress site. This tool is designed with a user-centric approach to facilitate businesses in streamlining their communication with customers through WhatsApp.

### Key Features
- **Automate WhatsApp Messaging:** Send and receive WhatsApp messages automatically from your site.
- **Webhook Configuration:** Configure webhooks for efficient message tracking.
- **Debugging and Webhook Logs:** Gain transparency and control over your communication with detailed logs.

## Getting Started

### Technical Stack and Setup Instructions

This tool is built on the Framework and uses the WhatsApp Business Cloud API for integration. To install and setup this tool, you need a Empress site and developer assets and credentials from the Meta Developer Portal.
